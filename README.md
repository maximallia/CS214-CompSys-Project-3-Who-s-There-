# CS214-CompSys-Project-3-Whos-There

In this assignment you will make use of C sockets to implement a simple network service: a knock knock joke server.

Knock knock jokes are extremely formulaic and often rely on simple puns and malapropisms. While not the height of sophisticated humor, their request/response structure and limited range of manipulation strongly mirrors network service protocols and as such are a good basic introduction to the same.

Your task will be to write a knock knock joke server using the protocols established below. There is an application protocol and a message format. The application protocol specifies what messages of what type are allowed when. The message format specifies how the application messages should be constructed and read/written from/to your sockets.
Your server should be able to handle a single humor-devoid client at a time.
